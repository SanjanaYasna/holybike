        <p>Welcome to HolyBike! We are a bike sharing service, focused on getting you places quickly and 
          cheaply! We love nature, discounts, and Bikael Helmut Wheeler the squirrel! He's fantastic and 
          he really loves being crunchy granola and a cheapskate. He also really loves early 2000's dial 
          up internet design. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We hope you enjoy riding bikes because that's all this is good for. We don't have the time or 
          energy to deal with E-scooters or cars. We hate lawsuits and pollution. 
          <br>So don't ask for that, we couldn't care less.
