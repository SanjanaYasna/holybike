1. Deleted unused_pages, users/login, and users/signup
- I deleted the unused_pages folder and removed users/login.html.erb and /signup.html.erb
- I kept the users folder for future use

2. Authorize now redirects to login if user not logged in
- Whenever I rails s after creating the database, I always get the "not authorized" message
- For, now I added this to application_controller.rb, it doesn't update the status like the render does 
```
unless @current_user
        flash[:error] = "Please login before accessing that page"
        redirect_to new_session_path
      end``` 

3. Stopped requiring user be logged in for registration
- Registration accidentally needed authorization so I added ```skip_before_action :authorize, only: [:new, :create]``` to the registrations controller

4. Commented out the users/signup and login paths in routes.rb 
5. Updated "VB LOGIN" button in registrations/new to point to the login page
- (TODO) Fix any remaining broken links 
6. (TODO) Create empty profile page?
